> I graduated from University of Stuttgart with Master degree. My major was INFOTECH, a mixture of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I found myself interested in machine learning during my course of study. However, it was during my Master thesis when I gained a lot of experience in reinforcement learning as well as practical experience in programming (python + TensorFlow). Here is the blog about [My Master Thesis](https://zhenkaishou.github.io/my-site/misc/2018/12/18/My-Master-Thesis/). Currently I am looking for a job in the field of machine learning.
