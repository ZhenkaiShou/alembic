## General Algorithms
This category contains stand alone implementation of general machine learning algorithms.

###### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
- Reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Policy optimization algorithm that works well in continous action space.
- Repository: [DDPG](https://github.com/ZhenkaiShou/project/tree/master/stand%20alone%20implementation/DDPG)

###### Mixture Density Networks
- Neural network architecture.
- Network model that learns a mixture of probability distributions of the input variables.
- Repository: [MDN](https://github.com/ZhenkaiShou/project/tree/master/stand%20alone%20implementation/MDN)

###### Neural Machine Translation
- Neural network architecture.
- Sequence to sequence model that transforms an input sequence into an output sequence.
- Repository: [NMT](https://github.com/ZhenkaiShou/project/tree/master/stand%20alone%20implementation/NMT)

###### Variational Autoencoder
- Neural network architecture.
- Generative model that learns useful features for image reconstruction while restricting the features close to normal distribution.
- Repository: [VAE](https://github.com/ZhenkaiShou/project/tree/master/stand%20alone%20implementation/VAE)

## Paper Algorithms
This category contains implementation of specific algorithms proposed in some papers.

###### Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning
- Reinforcement learning algorithm.
- Explore what will happen if an agent is trained purely by its own curiosity.
