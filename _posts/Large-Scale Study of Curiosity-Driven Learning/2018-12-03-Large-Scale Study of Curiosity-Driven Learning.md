In this blog I will talk about the [Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning](https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/resources/largeScaleCuriosity2018.pdf) paper developed by OpenAI, as well as giving some tips on how to reproduce it.

# What is Curiosity?

First of all, we need to understand what curiosity means to an agent. Let's say, a baby may explore its surroundings without specific goals. It may open a drawer, or crawl under the bed ... of course aimlessly. Then what drives it to do such meaningless things? Yes, that's the power of curiosity! A baby can be easily attracted by whatever looks new to it, until when the baby gets bored of it.
